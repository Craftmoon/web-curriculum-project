# Website Curriculum

I like Linux (did you know that penguins are kind of always squatting?).  
Curriculums made in Word sometimes get it's formatting warped when opened with LibreOffice Writer.  
Got mad at it.  
Made a website instead.  
The end.

## Installation

After cloning, use [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install running the following command in the project directory:

```bash
npm install
```

When it finishes, run the following command to start the application:

```bash
npm start
```

Done! Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser!
